# Octo-Pi-Tunes
 Different short musical tunes that you can add to OctoPrint

 ### How to use
 Install the [Gcode Macros](https://github.com/cp2004/OctoPrint-GcodeMacros) plugin into OctoPrint by finding it in the plugin manager.

Once installed:
 - Create a new Macro giving it a unique name (suggestion for name at top of each file)
 - Copy and paste the *Raw contents* of any file under the Tunes folder into the Macro editor
 - Save the macro

 Then from anywhere in any of your Gcode (like the end of print script in your slicer) add the command @NameOfMacro

 So for example, if the macro is named *YankeeDoodle* just put this one line in your gcode:
 ```
 @YankeeDoodle
 
 ```

And thats it!

Enjoy!
